                    Yes, since the current recruitment is only open for the respective campuses (Amritapuri/Bangalore), it is compulsory for you to
                    be part of the same campus to be part of the club.

                    Well, if your answer to more than one of these questions was yes, then we think you would be a good

                    bi0s is a club comprising of students alone, and works on a mentor-mentee model, wherein the new
                    recruits are trained and up-skilled by their seniors, their seniors are trained by their seniors,
                    and so on. This model has allowed the club to thrive and remain at the No. 1 position in India for
                    more than 7 years, and is one of the main reasons for our consistent global Top 5 position. <br><br>

                    If you join the club, you will be joining <b>the best</b> Cybersecurity club in the country.

                    No, prerequisite knowledge is not required to be a part of the club. This recruitment, the
                    resources, and the tasks behind it were designed keeping complete beginners in mind. There are a
                    bunch of resources starting from the ground up to help you with every step along the way.

                    A Linux installation is not mandatory to finish these tasks. They can also be done on Windows/MacOS
                    with no worries. However, since more of the work you do later on might be focused towards Linux, it
                    is recommended you be comfortable with it as well.

                    If you feel that the resources provided are not sufficient for you, we highly encourage you to
                    search on your own! If you are confused on what to search for or cannot find anything, please
                    contact us, and we will be glad to help you out.

                <h3>What do I do if I'm stuck on a task?</h3>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    If you are stuck on a task, at first it is highly recommended you Google to see if the issue you
                    faced has already been resolved in some way. This is useful because it teaches you to be
                    self-sufficient and find solutions to the unique problems that you may come across. <br><br>

                    However, do not let yourself be stuck for more than a day on something. Some of you might still be
                    in a "student" mindset that you have to solve everything by yourself. This is a broken mindset that
                    is unfortunately taught almost universally to us. Struggling alone and finding success gives you no
                    more points than taking help and finding it, and you're much more likely to succeed by working
                    through your problems with help. <br><br>

                    So, if you are stuck for too long with no progress, please contact us, and we will be more than
                    happy to help you out!

                    Phase 1 (Set-0 & Set-1)* is part of the initial phase of the recruitment process for this year. This
                    will be the level which will determine which of you make it to the next level. Finishing this phase
                    will take you to the next phase, bringing you one step closer to being part of the club. <br><br>

                    The next level will only be once you join the college, so you will be informed about it when the
                    time comes! <br><br>

                    *We highly recommend you attempt and finish Set-2 as well (although not compulsory)!

                    These tasks are meant to serve as more of a filtration round for the candidates and focuses more on
                    the basics of Computer Science itself, rather than Cybersecurity - to ensure your basics are strong
                    before you start diving into the various fields of Cybersecurity.

                    This recruitment is primarily meant to be an individual-based one, and although we are not against
                    you working in a group, please keep in mind that there will be more levels later on where it will be
                    purely individual-based. <br><br>

                    So, we highly encourage you to solve these questions individually, as this will help you learn and
                    prepare for the upcoming levels.
